As Sole Owner of Universal Contract Services, Johnny J .Barton brings over twenty years of front line, face to face customer service experience in the private sector and five years of federal government procurement experience as a Federal Government Card Holder where my daily duties as a civilian employee were to purchase supplies and services from business to support the Department of The Army.


## Differentiators

Universal Contract Services primary goal is to partner with prime contractors that currently have contracts with Federal, State and County Correctional Facilities which would be Cost Efficient for the prime contractor for their business while allowing Universal Contract Service to provide services. Universal Contract Services would increase productivity gain market share for the prime. Studies show that hiring a subcontractor could save the prime contractor 20-30 percent saving in annual salaries.
