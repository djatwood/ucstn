## Experience
As Sole Owner of Universal Contract Services, Johnny J .Barton brings over twenty years of front line and face to face customer service experience in the private sector. Over five years of federal government procurement experience as a Federal Government Card Holder, my daily duties as a civilian employee were to purchase supplies and services from small businesses to support the mission of the Department of The Army.


## Differentiators

Universal Contract Services has uniquely positioned itself to partner with prime contractors by bringing an experienced service professionals to gain a market share for a larger company in communities where it would not be cost efficient for a prime to do business. Universal Contract Services will increase productivity and would be interested in sharing the cost of a project that the prime is seeking. Universal Contract Services could save the prime contractor 20-30 percent saving in annually.
